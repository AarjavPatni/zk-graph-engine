# ZK Graph Engine â€“ Computational Graph Library

This Rust library provides a framework for creating and executing computational graphs with support for basic arithmetic operations, constraints, and hints. It is designed to be robust, efficient, and suitable for production environments.

## Basic Features

- [x]  **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition and multiplication of nodes.
- [x]  **Input and Constant Nodes**: Allows initialization of input nodes and constant values.
- [x]  **Constraint Checking**: Enables assertions of equality between nodes to ensure constraints are maintained.
- [x]  **Hint System**: Allows custom operations using hints for values computed outside the graph (e.g., division or square roots).
- [ ]  **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes a suite of tests covering various use cases and edge cases.
- [ ]  **Verbose Logging**: Configurable logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.


## Assumptions

This implementation assumes the following design decisions:

- Addition and multiplication overflow errors shouldn't panic but return `None` instead, along with an error log message.
- Division by zero should panic with a clear error message.


## Testing

The library includes a comprehensive suite of tests that cover various use cases and edge cases.

To run all tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

To run tests with verbose logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo test
```

You can change the logging level by setting the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to the desired level in the order of `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`.

Since the tests are run in parallel, the logging output may be interleaved. To avoid this, you can also run the tests sequentially:

```bash
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```


## Usage

Will be updated once the library is published.


## Future Improvements

- [ ]  **Graceful Error Handling**: Instead of panicking, the library should return a `Result` type for an improved developer experience.
- [ ]  **Topological Traversal**: Implement a method to traverse the graph in topological order, making the overall computation more efficient.
- [ ]  **Graph Visualization**: Implement a method to visualize the graph using a library like `petgraph` or `dot` for better debugging and monitoring.
